# pruneOldOpenstackImages

pruneOldOpenstackImages is tool to delete duplicate OpenStack images.

## Use

OpenStack (as many other computing platforms) allows you to create multiple VM images with the same name. This usually happens when you create a new version of the image after operations like update the OS packages. Image creation tools (such as Packer) are not resposible to clear up these duplicate images. So, a process needs to be implemented to clear them up. You can use pruneOldOpenstackImages to achieve this goal.

It is a good idea to have it as a part of image creation process in your CI flow and run at the end to prune unwanted, old duplicate images.
